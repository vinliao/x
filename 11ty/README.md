# Notes
Not sure why, but I feel like I can combine 11ty with svelte. I don't want to use sapper man, that shit is so complicated. I love svelte though.

On a second note... I don't think svelte is needed. I can just use plain html and sass to beautify this thing. There's nothing responsive in this site. It's just serving text. Why do I have to use svelte?

I'd love to integrate svelte here... but it seems like an overkill.
