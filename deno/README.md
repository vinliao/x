## Notes on deno
Deno is a browser for javascript. I can just "send a http request" then it will give me stuff. A browser parses html; deno runs js/ts code.

In some sense, that's what node and npm does too. It's taking stuff from the internet and I can run/play with that stuff.

Might require some toying before I fully understand what's going.
