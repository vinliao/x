# Setup steps

Svelte is a compiler. There is no `npx svelte abc.svelte -o bundle.js` or anything like that. The way it compile things is by using rollup.

So here's how the very basic setup works: create a js file where it imports and instantiate a new svelte file/component. The file then gets rolled-up by rollup, which spits out a `bundle.js` and that's what gets imported in html. There's a special plugin needed before the rollup can compile the svelte file, which is `rollup-plugin-svelte`. Magic happens below it. There's also a plugin that's needed to use external packages in node_modules, which is `@rollup/plugin-node-resolve`.

## Some thoughts on eleventy
I can actually combine eleventy with svelte.

Here's how everything works:
- Svelte (through rollup) creates a `.js` bundle by bundling all the `.svelte` files.
- Eleventy then can roll things up and put it inside `/_site`, and in there it contains `.html` files.
- If I can just "hook up" those `.html` generated by eleventy and the `.js` bundled by rollup and svelte, I can get these two things working.
- This means I can create site where it's fueled with markdown and arranged by svelte. Yes yes yes. Very cool

The question now is how can I add markdown support to this thing over here? How can I create a template which will generate html with the markdown content inside it?
