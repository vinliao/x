After more than a decade of using computers, I just realized that there's this thing called mailing list. I grew up with social media and see mailing list as this tool that old people use.

Hoo boy, I'm far from truth. There's a reason why email---despite its old age---is still around. They are very lindy. The concept of email and mailing list has been going for decades and there's no sign of stopping.

The versitality of mailing list is crazy. One of the novel thing about mailing list---as a guy that comes from social media---is the threading ability.

For example, take this list. I can create a list about a certain topic, then I can, in three days, append more ideas to this topic. This can be used as a brainstorming tool.

Very cool.

After toying with javascript and all its shenanigans, I feel disconnected. I feel like I'm always chasing the new thing while forgetting the old ones.

Old is not bad; they are lindy.

I'm so focused on web development that I see programming as web development. But programming is much more than that. I haven't even hack the linux-y stuff even though I've been using linux for years.

For now, this seems like an interesting language to get into:
- c
- haskell
- lisp

I know that hacking with these languages will make me view programming differently. My current way of viewing things is too narrow and uninspiring.

Here's a new discovery: disabling `margin: 0 auto` fixes the problem. So it's a problem of max-width and margin and margin to center it.

And to be quite honest, disabling the margin in the desktop grid layout looks very cool. Not only it solves the damn problem, but it also makes it look cool.
