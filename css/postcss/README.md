# toying with css tooling
Some notes on these guys:
- postcss is used for transforming css, and the "program" that transform is not the postcss itself, but plugins
- sass can be combined with postcss; first turn the .scss file to .css file, then give it to postcss

This is 2021, and writing css has reached this level of complexity.
