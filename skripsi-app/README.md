## Notes to self
### Images details
1. First iteration is my attempt to design a form without prior design knowledge (it's super shitty)
2. After reading design book on design principle, I made the form align correctly and increase the contrast of the heading on the second iteration. Much better!
3. On the third iteration, I'm trying to contrast the heading with a black serif font. I also decrease the contrast of the labels, it's better but not much.
4. On the fourth iteration, I changed the heading into sans serif font and make it thicc (lato 900). Looks much better and more modern. I also changed the black background to hsl(0, 0%, 15%); to make it contrast less.

### Notes on visual heirarchy
One of the most important aspect when creating a website is visual hierarchy. Every element in a page has different importance, the level of importance depends on what I want the user to pay attention on. What I need to do as a site builder/designer is to make important element seem important so the user pay attention to that element.

One of the best way to make sometihng looks important is by using contrast. There are couple of important things I want the user to pay attention to in this page: the name of the algorithm that's being optimized, and the number of gas reduced. I increase the contrast of both by using black thick sans serif font on a black background. By doing so, I make the element dominates other element, and the user's attention will go there.

There's also other elements that is important but not as important as the dominant element, the secondary in terms of importance. In this case, it's the form submit button and the before and after numbers of the result. I contrast them, but not as much as the main element. In the former case, I just make it black background and changes color on hover, but it has a small serif font. On the latter case, I made the font size big, and surround it with smaller and faded out description around it.

The rest of the element that's not mentioned above is tertiary, it has the least importance out of all elements. This includes the form label, the number description and the back button at result page. I decrease the contrast of these elements so that the user won't pay much attention to it (it's not really important after all). I did that by fading out the text, and in the case of button, not using thick colors as background (only border).

By having these hierarchy of importance makes the site easier to understand. This is because I force their eyes to pay attention to things that's worth paying attention to. No or wrong visual hierarchy confuses the eyes, imagine the text "gas used" is a red color with 50px font size and 900 font weight, it confuses the eyes because it's not important. People's eyes will be confused when their attention is directed to things that are not important.
