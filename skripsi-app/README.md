## Notes to self
### Images details
1. First iteration is my attempt to design a form without prior design knowledge (it's super shitty)
2. After reading design book on design principle, I made the form align correctly and increase the contrast of the heading on the second iteration. Much better!
3. On the third iteration, I'm trying to contrast the heading with a black serif font. I also decrease the contrast of the labels, it's better but not much.
4. On the fourth iteration, I changed the heading into sans serif font and make it thicc (lato 900). Looks much better and more modern. I also changed the black background to hsl(0, 0%, 15%); to make it contrast less.
