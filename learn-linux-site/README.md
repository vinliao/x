# Notes

What are the things that needs to be included?

What is the arrival point for those who take these challenges from start to finish?

- Files
- Text manipulation (basic like cat and echo)
- Networking (ssh, and stuff)
- Processes (htop maybe?)
- Text manipulation (advanced like awk, sed, grep)
- Permission (chmod, and maybe user permission)
- Edit something in the filesystem (e.g., editing a .desktop file somewhere inside `/`)
- Bash scripting (cron?)
- Vim... maybe
