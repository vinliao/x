# Introduction
tl;dr: remember to write a tldr here

Hello internet friends,

Let me tell you a story.

One week ago, I was really into cryptography. People on the internet suggest I take online courses and read books to learn it. I did that, but it just "didn't stick." Being bombarded with all those math symbols and theories are just too boring. Then I stumbled upon a site called [cryptopals.](https://cryptopals.com)

It's contains (hard) cryptography puzzles; it doesn't tell me "how to do" things; it explains things minimally; it gives short instruction. But my learning skyrocketed to the stratosphere by solving it compared to consuming books/videos.

Scouring all over the internet to find information, writing code, getting errors, trying this and that way of doing things, getting errors (again), and finally getting it right. It seems like this is the most effective way to learn.

This site attemps to provide those kind of puzzles about linux instead of shoving information down your throat.

## What are the rules?
There is no rule. 

You can watch tutorials and scour the internet as much as you like. But the more you get your hand dirty, try stuff, and discover things by your own (hopefully after some errors and mistakes), the more you'll learn.

## What are the prerequisite?
You have access to a linux machine and its terminal. That's it.

You can use any distro you want, any text editor you want, any shell you want.
