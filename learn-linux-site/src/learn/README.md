# Introduction
tl;dr: remember to write a tldr here

Hello internet friends,

Let me tell you a story.

One week ago, I was really into cryptography. People on the internet suggest I take online courses and read books to learn it. I did that, but it just "didn't stick." Being bombarded with all those math symbols and theories are just too boring. Then I stumbled upon a site called [cryptopals.](https://cryptopals.com)

It's contains (hard) cryptography puzzles; it doesn't tell me "how to do" things; it explains things minimally; it gives short instruction. But my learning skyrocketed to the stratosphere by solving it compared to consuming books/videos.

Scouring all over the internet to find information, writing code, getting errors, trying this and that way of doing things, getting errors (again), and finally getting it right. It seems like this is the most effective way to learn.

This site attemps to provide those kind of puzzles on linux.

## About me
No, I'm not a linux or command-line expert. I know some things about it and would like to make it into puzzles.

This entire thing is free and open-sourced. Contributions are welcomed.

## About the puzzles
There is only one rule: there is no rule.

You can use anything you want. The more you try things out, the more you'll learn.

Instructions will be provided; minimal explanation.

Let's go.
