This is a place to experiment blog design.

Here's what I want to build:
- Simple design. No unnecessary text/widget
- Dark mode
- Serif font (it looks cool)
- A place to separate my personal blog from tech blog. Maybe use categories. Not sure. (The question now is... do I even need a tech blog?)

Fonts to try out:
- Literata
- Garamond
- Baskerville

Features to have:
- Dark mode (toggle maybe)
- Display next set of posts in home
- Next and previous post in bottom
- Search?
