## Notes to self
### On json server
I've spent the last 2 hours fiddling with json-server. It's such a huge waste of time. I think that the json server thing is great for simulating list rendering (get data from server then render), but it's not really great for post request, especially when the data has weird relationships.

Server-json is extremely helpful for creating a dirty prototype. This is especially helpful when combined with 37signals's approach to app building: start with the interface first. Using json-server lets us focus on the interface rather than the code.
