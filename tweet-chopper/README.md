# Tweet chopper

This tool is a dead-simple tool to read a txt file and turn it into a tweetstorm. Sometimes it's a hassle to write tweetstorm in a twitter web client.

And also, this tool will be a cli (as of this writing, it's not yet). The goal here is to create a mini-app distributed through a place (maybe npm?). After `npm install -g packagename` the user can immediately chop txt files of their liking and send them as tweetstorm!

Here is the core feature that I have in mind: the ability to chop up a txt file and send them as a thread or individual tweets.
