Not sure why, but I'm kinda attracted to this css layout thing.

I've studied and played with this in the past, but it seems like I'm not yet a master at this.

Sounds fun (for now).

Mini description of each experiment:
- flex: random experiment with flexbox
- grid: random experiment with grid 
- toggle: an attempt to create a night mode toggle (with animation) with css
- csszengarden: creating weird layout using css grid with modified [csszengarden](csszengarden.com) markup

## Notes
### csszengarden
While it's really cool to be able to createa grid like that, there are several issues with it:
- right-aligned text are hard to read. There are some circumstances where right/center aligned text keeps the legibility of text (titles/subtitles mostly)
- the gaps in between requires the eyes to move a lot, and that's really annoying
- I don't know, the overall thing is very confusing. It's technically cool, but it's just too confusing to be consumed.
