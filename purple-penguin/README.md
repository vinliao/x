# Notes

**This project is discontinued**

Questions to myself:
- What are the things that needs to be included?
- What is the arrival point for those who take this challenge?
- What are the things I wish I had known when I first jumped into linux?
- What kind of thing(s) would I like to spark within the people who take these challenges?

Some potential chapters
- Files
- Text manipulation (basic like cat and echo)
- Networking (ssh, and stuff)
- Processes (htop maybe?)
- Text manipulation (advanced like awk, sed, grep)
- Permission (chmod, and maybe user permission)
- Edit something in the filesystem (e.g., editing a .desktop file somewhere inside `/`)
- Bash scripting (cron?)
- Vim... maybe
- softlink hardlink (`ln` command)
