# Introduction
Effective learning happens when one discover something on their own instead of having information shoved down his throat.

Scouring all over the internet to find information, writing code, getting errors, trying this and that way of doing things, getting errors (again), and finally getting it right is more effective than reading books/watching videos.

This website tries to provide minimally-explained linux puzzles. It forces you to dive directly into the subject matter and get your hands dirty.

## What are the rules?
There is no rule. 

You can watch tutorials and scour the internet if you wish. But the more you get your hand dirty, try stuff, and discover things by your own (especially after some errors and mistakes), the more you'll learn.

## What are the prerequisite?
You have access to a linux machine and its terminal. That's it. No prior linux/terminal knowledge needed.

You can use any distro you want, any text editor you want, any shell you want.
