# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my lab. I experiment and play around a lot with technologies (especially new ones). Instead of making a million different repository for all my experiments, I just put it all here. I usually delete old and boring experiments to keep this lab clean. Peek around, don't be shy.

Here are some experiments that, I think, are super cool:
1. [minimalist-grid](https://github.com/vinliao/x/tree/master/minimalist-grid) Bootstrap grid system in 70 lines of code ðŸ‘€
2. [hide-trending-twitter](https://github.com/vinliao/x/tree/master/hide-trending-twitter) I use web twitter everyday and the last thing I want to see is the useless and distracting trending hashtags on the side. This small firefox extension is the solution to that.
