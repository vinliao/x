# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my lab. I experiment and play around a lot with technologies (especially new ones). Instead of making a million different repository for all my experiments, I just put it all here. I usually delete old and boring experiments to keep this lab clean. Peek around, don't be shy.

Here are some cool experiments that I think you should check out:
1. [minimalist-grid](https://github.com/vinliao/x/tree/master/minimalist-grid) Bootstrap grid system in 70 lines of code ðŸ‘€ 
2. [nistris-vue](https://github.com/vinliao/x/tree/master/nistris-vue) I implemented the design fundamentals I learned on this web project. It's the first time ever I created a site/app that doesn't suck.
